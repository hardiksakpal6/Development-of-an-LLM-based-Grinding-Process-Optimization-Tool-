# Development-of-an-LLM-based-Grinding-Process-Optimization-Tool

The methodology section of your thesis, "Development of an LLM-based Grinding Process Optimization Tool for an Efficient Production of Battery Materials," focuses on the design and implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with digital twin technology. This system is presented through a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) called particleOS.ai. The core of the methodology revolves around leveraging AI capabilities, numerical and visual data processing, and digital twin functionality to provide specialized particle-related analysis.

My primary contribution to the particleOS.ai project involved the structured development of three main interactive tabs within the interface: "Process Modelling & Understanding," "Process Optimization," and "Database Access".   

The methodology covers the following key areas in detail:

Features and Core Competencies of the Particle Expert RAG Tool
The Particle Expert RAG Tool is an advanced, AI-driven platform designed for the study and optimization of particle-based processes. It combines the capabilities of the LLaMA 3 language model with specialized knowledge in particle processing. Its key features include:   

Process Modeling and Optimization: Facilitates the creation and optimization of detailed particle-process models, allowing users to define parameters, simulate scenarios, and identify optimal conditions.   
Numerical and Image Data Analysis: Enables seamless analysis of extensive numerical and image-based data using advanced analytical techniques to derive insights, patterns, and correlations.   
Integration with Specialized Databases: Allows for easy access to extensive, structured data repositories containing technical and domain-specific information.   
Access to Technical Literature and Data: Provides direct connectivity to relevant technical literature and field-specific data repositories to aid in decision-making and process validation.   
Real-time Process Optimization: Supports real-time optimization through AI capabilities and sophisticated data processing, enabling continuous monitoring, adjustment of parameters, and instant visualization of impacts.   
Digital Twin Integration: Integrates with digital twin technology to provide virtual replicas of physical particle-processing systems for dynamic monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization in a risk-free environment.   
The tool's functionalities are built upon several critical core components:

Fine-tuned LLaMA 3 & ParticleOS.ai Functionality: Leverages a fine-tuned LLaMA 3 model with ParticleOS.ai-specific knowledge for accurate understanding, contextual awareness, and tailored recommendations.   
Specialized Data Storage and Tokenization: Incorporates specialized data storage and advanced tokenization methods for swift and secure data retrieval, indexing, and utilization.

Pre-trained Process Models Integration: Includes pre-trained machine learning models for quick initiation and accurate prediction of particle-process outcomes.   
Access to Field-specific Literature and Technical Data: Ensures comprehensive access to domain-specific literature, databases, and technical documents.   
Selection of the Open-Source Model
For the development of the Particle Expert RAG Tool, Meta's LLaMA 3.1, specifically the 8 billion parameter version, was selected. The rationale for this choice was its ability to run efficiently on local hardware while providing strong performance. Ollama, an open-source framework for local deployment of large language models, was used for implementation, simplifying the downloading, management, and running of the model.   

Several other open-source models were considered, but LLaMA 3.1 was chosen for its balance of size, accuracy, availability, and computational efficiency compared to larger models like LLaMA 2 (13B and 70B) and LLaMA 3 (70B), or smaller models like LLaMA 2 (7B).   

Tab: Process Modeling and Understanding
This tab focuses on building an interactive analysis and visualization platform powered by the LLaMA 3.1 model integrated via Ollama.   

Key steps involved:

Loading the AI Model: The LLaMA 3.1 model is loaded through Ollama for efficient local execution.   
User Interaction and Prompt Handling: The system receives user input (dataset upload and queries) and interprets the intent to trigger appropriate actions.   
Generating Python Code using Llama 3.1: For visualization or complex analysis queries, the LLM generates Python code tailored to the dataset. This code is extracted, supplemented with necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), and saved.   
Executing generated Python Code and Error Handling: The generated Python code is executed safely using automated subprocesses, with error capturing and retrying mechanisms.   
Data Analysis and Feature Evaluation: Detailed statistical analyses, including correlation measures (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) and feature importance evaluation, are performed.   
Visualization of Analytical Results: Custom visualization methods are used to present analysis results intuitively, including Data Distribution Scanner, Relationship Stability Radar, Feature Family Tree (Dendrogram), Correlation and Importance Analysis, and 3D Importance Explorer.   
Integration and Interactive Response: Analysis and visualization results are presented back to the user within the interface.   
Robustness and User Experience Enhancement: Attention is paid to user experience through prompt validation, dataset integrity checks, and informative error messages.   
The core logic for interactive data analysis and visualization involves:

User Interaction (Prompt Submission): Users submit queries through a text input area.   
Query Interpretation and Task Classification: Queries are categorized into Data Distribution & Analysis, Chart Preparation, or General Answer Queries.   
Task-specific Processing: Based on the query type, the system either sends the query to LLaMA for tool suggestions and visualization generation, prompts LLaMA to generate Python code for charting, or interprets the query to execute Python expressions for general answers.   
Error Handling and Robustness: Mechanisms are integrated to check for execution issues and provide informative error messages.   
Session-based Communication and Interaction Logging: User queries and AI responses are logged to maintain a history of interactions.   
The algorithm for Process Modeling and Understanding details the structured workflow for managing and responding to user queries, including analyzing the query, switching based on task type, handling tool suggestions, generating and executing Python code, and managing errors.   

Tab: Process Optimization
This tab provides an interactive system for integrating a trained machine learning model and an LLM for process optimization tasks.   

Key steps involved:

User Interface and Data Upload: Users upload a trained ML model and a reference dataset via the Streamlit interface.   
Model Loading and Customization: The system loads pre-trained models in various formats (.pkl, .joblib, .h5) using a custom loading process, including handling custom input shapes and loading scalers.   
Predictions and Inference: The system extracts values from user input, scales features using the loaded scaler, and passes them to the trained model for prediction. If the query is a prediction request, the system returns the predicted output.   
The core logic and algorithm for Process Optimization handles user queries by using a trained ML model for predictions and an LLM for natural language responses. The algorithm processes prediction requests by extracting features, scaling them, and generating a prediction, while non-prediction queries are handled by generating a context-aware response using the LLM. The algorithm also includes displaying processing spinners, formatting and displaying results, and logging the conversation.   

Tab: Database Access
The Database Access Tab is designed for interaction with technical data, allowing users to query and retrieve relevant information.   

Key steps involved:

User Input and Query Expansion: The system receives technical questions from users and expands the query using a query expander model for better retrieval results.   
Web Scraping and Crawling: If necessary, the system scrapes and crawls websites to gather relevant technical information, splitting the content into chunks.   
Document Splitting: Text from both PDF and website content is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing and indexing.   
Embedding Creation and Vector Store: Embeddings are generated for document chunks using a pre-trained sentence transformer model and stored in a FAISS vector store for fast similarity-based retrieval.   
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline: User queries are expanded to retrieve relevant documents from the vector store. These documents are then passed to the fine-tuned LLM (LLaMA 3.1) to generate a response that incorporates the retrieved information.   
Interaction and Displaying Results: The system processes the expanded query using the RAG pipeline, returns the LLM-generated response, logs the conversation, and displays the interaction in the user interface.   
Data Preprocessing and Embedding Storage: PDF documents are preprocessed by splitting them into chunks and storing embeddings in a local FAISS index. Existing indexes are loaded, or new ones are created and saved.   
Key terms explained in the context of this tab include Chunking, Embedding, Prompting, Cross-Encoder, FAISS, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).   

The algorithm for Database Access Query Handling details the step-by-step process of query handling, including expanding the query, retrieving documents from the vector store, using a cross-encoder to rank documents (if asking for technical insights), passing retrieved documents to the LLM for response generation, formatting and displaying the response, and storing the conversation.
